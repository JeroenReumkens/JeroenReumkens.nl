          Back then you started out as a <em>webdeveloper</em>, or even a{' '}
          <em>webmaster</em>. Building full experiences, ranging from{' '}
          <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, some <em>JavaScript</em> and also lots of{' '}
          <em>PHP</em> and <em>Wordpress</em> in my case.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just like everyone back in the days I even built my own <em>CMS</em>.

      <BadgeAndText
        illustrationAlt="Mind blown animation"
        illustrationTitle="Focus"

          The name <em>`webmaster`</em> was probably well deserved because you
          were responsible for building everything from <em>A==&gt;Z</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though it didn't take long before I started to realize that there was
          this one part I was inspired by from day one â€” leaving an impression
          on peoples faces when they use my products.
        </p>

        <p>
          This made me realise that I needed to <em>&gt;= focus &lt;=</em> and
          specialise myself on frontend.
