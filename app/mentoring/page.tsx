            Nowadays frontend is a very extensive field. Every week there seem
            to be popping up a new standards, browsers are adopting new features
            quicker than ever before and you can build pretty much anything with
            frontend tooling. Where do you even start improving yourself? Will
            you ever have to time to learn it all?!
          </p>

          <p>
            Exactly why I am opinionated (I don't do Angular ðŸ˜‰{' '}
            <small>
              â€” huge fan of React, but always open for new things on the horizon
            </small>
            ). I'm convinced that if you want to grow in frontend, you need to
            focus. Focus on the things that are important right now, don't jump
            on every hype train and <u>focus on the fundamentals</u> of
            frontend. These fundamentals apply to every new framework that comes
            around.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal is to teach you create online experiences that{' '}
            <u>stand out</u>, by making frontend the most important piece of the
            puzzle. I'll teach you to make the craziest things with CSS â€” even
            fall in love with CSS. I will show you there's a whole group of
            visually impaired people out there who also try to use the web, or
            people who don't have the same speedy internet as you. I will also
            convince you that TypeScript is not as scary as you might think ðŸ«£.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will show you areas of frontend you never knew existed. That
            includes anything from CSS, accessibility, performance,
            JavaScript/TypeScript, to library specific things like React or
            NextJS, or more technical things like generating types from your
            backend API's to make frontend life easier.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will make you a frontend engineer that will stand out above the
            rest.
          </p>

          <p className="italic">
            Besides all the technical stuff, I've also worked in a lot of
            different teams and with a lot of different clients. Many of them
            also requiring me to grow in my soft skills. I'm sure I'll have some
            great advice in that as well.
