            Needless to say JavaScript is really important as well â€” or
            TypeScript in my opinion.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, I strongly believe that JS should always enhance the
            experience, not be your default solution to a problem. During my
            career I've seen too many frontenders use JavaScript as their
            primary tool and threat HTML and CSS secondary. Resulting in poor
            frontend quality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently my main library of choice is React, often in combination
            with a library like NextJS or Remix. I think React brings the right
            mix between complexity and flexibility, is very scalable and has a
            really powerful and innovative ecosystem. I always keep my eyes open
            for any new solutions that might be around the corner. Although that
            probably won't be Angular any time soon ðŸ˜….
          </p>

          <p>
            So yeah, I'm probably a bit opinionated. Something that's neccessary
            with the vast array of options in frontend world.
