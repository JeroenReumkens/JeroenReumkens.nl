              This session is great for us to get to know each other, and for me

              You can only book this session once since this intro chat has a

            <p>
              Sometimes it's good to have a second pair of eyes. Perhaps you're
              taking over a project from a different agency, you're just unsure
              if the code you've written yourself is actually any good, or want
              to have someone review your job application case before submitting
              it. I'd love to help.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please make sure to give me access to the code before the meeting
              starts (in a git environment like Github, Gitlab, etc), so we're
              up to speed as quickly as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also keep in mind that depending on the size of the codebase, it
              might be very hard to grab my head around it in 60 minutes. In
              this case it might be wise to stack multiple of these sessions.
              Reach out to me via the button below for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              This meeting consists of max 15 minute discussing the project
              together, and me 45 minutes looking through your code and giving
              as much feedback as possible, preferably in a PR.
