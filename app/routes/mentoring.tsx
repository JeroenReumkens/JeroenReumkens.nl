              My goal is to teach people creating the best online experiences
              out there. I do this by making frontend the most important piece
              of the puzzle. I'll teach you how to{' '}
              <strong>make the craziest things with CSS</strong> â€” heck even
              fall in love with CSS. I will show you there's a whole group of{' '}
              <strong>
                visually impaired people out there who also try to use the web
              </strong>
              , or{' '}
              <strong>people who don't have the same speedy internet</strong> as
              you might have in your home office.
            </p>

            <p className="grain rounded-md bg-gray p-3 text-body shadow-hard">
              So in short; I will show you areas of frontend you never knew
              existed. That includes anything from CSS, accessibility,
              performance, JavaScript/TypeScript, to library specific things
              like React or NextJS or more technical things like generating
              types from your backend API's to make frontend life easier.

              what I try to achieve.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, besides all the technical stuff, I've also worked in a
              lot of different teams and with a lot of different clients. Many
              of them also requiring me to grow in my soft skills. Saying no to
              a client or your boss? That's scary right! I'm sure I'll have some
              great advice in that as well.
