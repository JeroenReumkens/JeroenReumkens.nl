            I see frontend as a craft and an everlearning journey â€” a journey on
            which I love to take you, while teaching you a few things along the
            way.

          While scrolling through my past experience you might notice that I
          pivoted a few times between freelance and working for an agency... â€”
          Why? I've always been in search of a place where I could both create
          great online experiences, as well share my passion for the craft with
          other people. I never found the place to do that to my full potential.

        />

        <p className=" text-body sm:w-2/3 sm:text-xl">
          That's why I've decided to do things a bit different: I'm creating a
          platform where I share all the knowledge I have, and give people the
          possibility to pick my brain!
