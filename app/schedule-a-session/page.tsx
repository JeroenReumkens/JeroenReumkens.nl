            This session is great for us to get to know each other, and for me
            to explain what value I could offer you during follow up sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can only book this session once since this intro chat has a
            special discount applied to it.

          <p>
            Sometimes it's good to have a second pair of eyes. Perhaps you're
            taking over a project from a different agency, you're just unsure if
            the code you've written yourself is actually any good, or want to
            have someone review your job application case before submitting it.
            I'd love to help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please make sure to give me access to the code before the meeting
            starts (in a git environment like Github, Gitlab, etc), so we're up
            to speed as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also keep in mind that depending on the size of the codebase, it
            might be very hard to grab my head around it in 60 minutes. In this
            case it might be wise to create a longer meeting. Reach out to me
            for more info :)
          </p>
          <p>
            This meeting consists of max 15 minute discussing the project
            together, and me 45 minutes looking through your code and giving as
            much feedback as possible, preferably in a PR.
          </p>
