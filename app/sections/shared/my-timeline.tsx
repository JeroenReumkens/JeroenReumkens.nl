            creating technical vision, supporting and educating other engineers,
            advising clients and projects and finding the right balance between
            quality and time / effort.

            We've build multiple greenfield JAM-stack websites (SSG rendered

            regulations, travel restrictions, and quarantine compliancy. Finally
            we've also build a registration platform for any citizens traveling
            to the Netherlands, providing the citizens with a certificate which
            would be validated at the border.

            During the Covid pandemic I joined the Dutch Police in creating
            internal dashboarding. These dashboards helped the Dutch government
            in keeping track on all statistics around the pandemic â€” ranging
            from available hospital beds to fines.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal of the dashboard was creating a platform that could be used
            for any future crisis. Currently the tool is being used to help
            Ukrainian refugees in the Netherlands in finding a place to stay as
            quickly and efficiently as possible.

            As the lead frontend engineer my main task was creating solid

            and guiding the three teams in their daily work.
          </p>

          <p>
            My responsibilities were: Joining the different teams in their
            development work; Supporting, coaching and teaching the engineers,
            doing code reviews, pair programming, etc; Consulting Vodafone in
            their digital roadmap. Part of that is creating plans to improve the
            other legacy modules as well. And start implementing these plans;
            Creating more bridges (especially technical, coding standards,
            techniques used, etc) between the differently located Vodafone and
            Ziggo digital teams. Making sure there is one vision / direction for
            the digital department.
