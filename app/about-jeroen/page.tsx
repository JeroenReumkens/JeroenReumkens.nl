          <Title>Hi, I'm Jeroen,</Title>
          <p className="mb-3">
            a frontend engineer with a passion for the web, trying to make
            people smile when using my products.
          </p>
          <p>
            I see frontend as a craft and an everlearning journey â€” a journey on
            which I love to take you, while teaching you a few things along the
            way.

          While scrolling through my past experience you might notice that I
          pivoted a few times between freelance and working for an agency...
        </p>
        <p>
          â€” Why? I've always been in search of a place where I could both create
          great online experiences, as well share my passion for the craft with
          other people. I never found the place to do that to my full potential.
        </p>

          line1="With experienced engineers becoming harder and harder to find,"
          line2="it's becoming more relevant than ever to have someone to teach you the craft and help you or your team grow to the next level."
        />

        <p>
          That's why I've decided to do things a bit different: I'm creating a
          platform where I share all the knowledge I have, and give people the
          possibility to pick my brain!
          <br />
          More on that soon.
